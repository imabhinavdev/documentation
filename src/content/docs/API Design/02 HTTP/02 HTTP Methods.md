title: HTTP Methods
description: Learn about the different HTTP methods (verbs) used in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to interact with web servers and resources.
---
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods, also known as HTTP verbs, specify the action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. Each method defines a specific operation, allowing clients (such as web browsers) to interact with web servers in various ways without directly accessing server internals.

### Commonly Used HTTP Methods

1. **GET**: Retrieves data from a specified resource without altering it. GET requests should only retrieve data and should not have side effects on the server. It is primarily used for fetching webpages, images, or any other static content from servers.

2. **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. POST requests are typically used for creating new resources on the server or submitting form data. Unlike GET, POST requests may have side effects such as creating a new record in a database.

3. **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server. PUT requests are used to modify existing data. They replace the entire resource if it already exists or create a new resource if it doesn't.

4. **DELETE**: Removes a specified resource from the server. DELETE requests are used to delete resources identified by a specific URL. They should be used with caution as they irreversibly remove data from the server.

5. **HEAD**: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers of the response without the message body. HEAD requests are useful for checking the metadata of a resource, such as its size or last modified date, without downloading the entire content.

6. **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource. PATCH requests are used to apply partial updates to a resource. Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH is used for making small changes to specific parts of the resource.

7. **OPTIONS**: Retrieves the HTTP methods supported by a server for a specific URL. OPTIONS requests are used to determine the communication options available for a target resource. They can be useful for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and other access control scenarios.

8. **TRACE**: Echoes the received request so that clients can see what changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers. TRACE requests are primarily used for debugging purposes to trace the request as it travels through proxies and servers.

### Choosing the Right HTTP Method

- **GET**: Use when retrieving data from the server, such as fetching webpages, images, or other resources.
  
- **POST**: Use when submitting data to the server, such as submitting form data or creating new resources.
  
- **PUT**: Use when updating existing resources on the server, typically by replacing the entire resource with the new data.
  
- **DELETE**: Use when removing resources from the server, ensuring caution as this action is irreversible.
  
- **PATCH**: Use when making partial updates to existing resources, applying small changes without replacing the entire resource.
  
- **HEAD**: Use when retrieving metadata about a resource, such as checking its size or last modified date, without downloading the entire content.
  
- **OPTIONS**: Use when determining the communication options available for a target resource, particularly for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and access control.
  
- **TRACE**: Primarily used for debugging purposes to trace the request as it travels through proxies and servers.

### Conclusion

Understanding HTTP methods is essential for effective web communication and building robust web applications. Each method defines a specific action that clients can perform on server resources, facilitating data retrieval, submission, modification, and deletion. By choosing the appropriate HTTP method for each interaction, developers can ensure efficient and secure communication between clients and servers.
