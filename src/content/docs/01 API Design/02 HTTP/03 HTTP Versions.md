title: HTTP Versions
description: Learn about the different versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), their features, and evolution over time.

---
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) woh protocol hai jo World Wide Web pe communication ke liye use hota hai. Samay ke sath HTTP evolve hua hai different versions ke through, jisme naye features aur improvements include hain taaki web applications ke growing complexity aur requirements ko accommodate kiya ja sake.

### HTTP Versions Ka Evolution

1. **HTTP/0.9**:
   - Introduced in 1991.
   - Bohot basic protocol tha.
   - Sirf GET requests ko support karta tha HTML documents retrieve karne ke liye.

2. **HTTP/1.0**:
   - Released in 1996.
   - GET ke alawa additional HTTP methods (POST, HEAD, etc.) ko support karta tha.
   - Status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found) introduce kiye gaye.
   - Ek single TCP connection ke through multiple objects send kiye ja sakte the.

3. **HTTP/1.1**:
   - Released in 1997.
   - HTTP/1.0 ke comparison me efficiency aur performance improve hui.
   - Persistent connections (keep-alive) introduce kiye taaki latency reduce ho.
   - Chunked transfer encoding introduce hua for sending large data.

4. **HTTP/2**:
   - Released in 2015.
   - Major overhaul with better performance.
   - Multiple requests aur responses ko single connection pe multiplex karna support karta hai, latency reduce karta hai.
   - Header compression (HPACK) introduce hui taaki overhead kam ho.
   - Servers ko proactively responses push karne allow karta hai.

5. **HTTP/3**:
   - Released in 2020.
   - QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) use karta hai as underlying transport protocol instead of TCP jo previous versions me use hota tha.
   - Performance improve karta hai, especially high packet loss ya latency wale scenarios me.
   - Enhanced security features aur faster connection establishment provide karta hai compared to HTTP/2.

### Key Differences aur Improvements

- **Performance**: Har version ka aim performance metrics jaise latency, throughput, aur efficiency of data transfer improve karna hai.
  
- **Security**: Newer versions ne security enhancements introduce kiye hain, jaise stronger encryption standards aur improved resistance to attacks like connection hijacking.
  
- **Multiplexing**: HTTP/2 ne multiplexing introduce kiya, jo multiple requests aur responses ko single connection pe handle karne allow karta hai, latency reduce aur efficiency improve karta hai.

- **Protocol Optimization**: HTTP/2 aur HTTP/3 ne protocol optimizations introduce kiye jaise header compression (HTTP/2) aur reduced connection establishment overhead (HTTP/3).

### Choosing the Right HTTP Version

- **HTTP/1.1**: Abhi bhi widely used aur supported across most web servers aur clients. Suitable for most applications unless performance under heavy load ya high latency critical ho.
  
- **HTTP/2**: Significant performance improvements offer karta hai HTTP/1.1 ke comparison me, especially scenarios me jahan multiple resources ya high-latency networks ho. Modern web applications ke liye recommended.
  
- **HTTP/3**: Further performance enhancements offer karta hai HTTP/2 ke comparison me, particularly scenarios me with high packet loss ya unreliable connections. Adoption grow kar rahi hai, especially for cutting-edge applications.

### Conclusion

HTTP versions ko samajhna crucial hai taaki web performance optimize ho aur modern web standards ke sath compatibility ensure ho. Har version apne predecessors pe build karta hai taaki new challenges aur requirements ko address kiya ja sake web communication me. HTTP evolution ke bare me informed rehkar, developers latest features aur improvements leverage kar sakte hain taaki faster, more secure, aur efficient web applications build kiya ja sake. HTTP versions ko embrace karo apne pathway ke roop me towards a faster aur more responsive web experience! üåê
